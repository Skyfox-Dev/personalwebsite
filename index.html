        <article>
            <h4>Welcome to my personal website</h4>
            <p>
                An 21 year old german, apprentice specialising in systemintegration. I have a passion for building and
                mainting
                IT-Systems, but generally, you could say that I am interested in most IT-Based topics. Another passion
                of mine is
                in Radio Technology (mostly WebSDR based Stuff).
                <br>
                <br>
                Next to systemintegration, I also possess skills in programming (Java, Javascript) and things like
                webdesign (this website
                as an example). I also used alot of my time getting a fairly decent knowledge of media design, being
                able to use both photoshop
                and multiple video-cutting softwares. These are also combined with my interest in audio-technology,
                where I also spent my fair share
                and money getting my own low/mid-end audio setup. More details are on my CV.
                <br>
                <br>
                This website is just a random side-project for me, which I also plan to provide with future
                applications.
                I am unsure where this all will go, but time will tell.
