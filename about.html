                    An 18 year old german, apprentice specialising in systemintegration. I have a passion for building and mainting
                    IT-Systems, but generally, you could say that I am interested in most IT-Based topics. Another passion of mine is
                    in Radio Technology (mostly WebSDR based Stuff).

                    <br>
                    Next to systemintegration, I also possess skills in programming (Java, Javascript) and things like webdesign (this website
                    as an example). I also used alot of my time getting a fairly decent knowledge of media design, being able to use both photoshop
                    and multiple video-cutting softwares. These are also combined with my interest in audio-technology, where I also spent my fair share
                    and money getting my own low/mid-end audio setup. More details are on my CV.

                    This website is just a random side-project for me, which I also plan to provide with future applications.
                    I am unsure where this all will go, but time will tell. If you want to contact me, please refer to the upper-right button.
